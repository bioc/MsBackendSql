Description: SQL-based mass spectrometry (MS) data backend supporting also
             storange and handling of very large data sets. Objects from
	     this package are supposed to be used with the Spectra Bioconductor
	     package. This package thus additional support for very large or
	     remote MS data sets to the Spectra package.
