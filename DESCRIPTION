Description: SQL-based mass spectrometry (MS) data backend supporting also
             storange and handling of very large data sets. Objects from
	     this package are supposed to be used with the Spectra Bioconductor
	     package. Through the MsBackendSql with its minimal memory
	     footprint, this package thus provides an alternative MS data
	     representation for very large or remote MS data sets.
