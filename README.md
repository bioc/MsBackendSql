This repository represents a playground of ideas to handle very large MS data
sets stored within SQL databases. It's functionality is somewhat redundant with
the [MsBackendSql](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/MsBackendSql) backend
which is however thought to be a *stable* and working backend, while this is
mostly used to test the limits of SQL backed data representations.
